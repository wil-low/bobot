## ðŸ“Š Alpha Portfolio Management System

This project implements a rules-based portfolio management system inspired by *The Alpha Formula* by Chris Cain, Larry Connors, and Connors Research, LLC. It focuses on systematic daily rebalancing using quantitative allocation strategies.

Unlike the `bobot` project (which executes trades), `alpha` generates **daily allocation recommendations**â€”indicating which assets to buy or sellâ€”without submitting actual orders. Designed for semi-automated or fully manual execution.
