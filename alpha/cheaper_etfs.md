---

✅ Main theme: **cheaper share prices, lower expense ratios, or broader exposure** while keeping the **same core asset class coverage**.
⚠️ Only **XOP** is actually *more expensive per share* than XLE — but it gives a more balanced energy sector bet (less Exxon/Chevron concentration), so it was kept.

---

Do you want me to **further flag which replacements also have lower expense ratios** (not just cheaper price per share)? That would clarify where you’re truly saving long-term costs.

```
I invest in ETFs with leverage 1:1 (frequently as CFD) so I doubt there is any expense ratio involved, only spread
```

Ahh — that changes things 👍

If you’re trading **ETFs as CFDs with 1:1 leverage**, then:

* **Expense ratio is irrelevant** → you don’t actually hold the ETF, so you’re not paying the fund’s management fees.
* **Your costs = spread + overnight swap (if held overnight)**.
* Therefore the **main reason to choose the cheaper alternative** is not cost-efficiency over time, but:

  * ✅ **Lower share price** → more granular position sizing (you can scale in/out with smaller steps).
  * ✅ **Better liquidity / tighter spreads** (SPLG, SCHG, GLDM etc. still have strong liquidity, even if not as massive as SPY/QQQ/GLD).
  * ✅ **Exposure tilt** (like XOP vs. XLE, SCHD vs. DIA).

So your replacement list makes sense from a **practical CFD-trading perspective**: you’re keeping exposure to the same asset classes but with units < \$100 where possible, which makes Avalanche-style layering more flexible.

👉 The only case where the replacement isn’t “cheaper” is **XOP vs. XLE**, but you gain **equal-weight energy** which tends to be more volatile (better for your strategy).

Would you like me to **reorganize the table** to focus just on what matters for CFD trading —

* share price (granularity),
* liquidity / popularity,
* volatility differences —
  instead of mentioning expense ratios at all?

```
back in time, you suggested JPST as a cheaper (in price) alternative to SHY but I see they differ significantly in maturity. The Alpha Formula by Connors mentions SHY and I wanted a a cheaper (in price) alternative for it while keeping other performance figures similar
```

You’re correct to question the earlier suggestion of using **JPST** as a “cheaper price alternative” to **SHY** in the context of **The Alpha Formula by Connors** strategy — because **JPST is a very different product** in terms of duration and risk profile.

**Key distinction**:

* **SHY** (iShares 1–3 Year Treasury Bond ETF) holds *U.S. Treasury notes with ~1–3 year maturities*, giving it a moderate short-duration exposure to the Treasury curve. ([etf.com][1])
* **JPST** (JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF) is a *ultra-short bond ETF* that includes corporate and other non-Treasury short-term credit, with a much shorter effective duration than SHY and different return characteristics.

Because your objective is to find a *cheaper (lower price per share) alternative to **SHY*** while keeping **similar maturity / duration characteristics and overall performance behavior**, a better set of candidates are **other short-term Treasury ETFs** rather than JPST.

Here are alternatives that align more closely with SHY’s exposure but typically trade at a lower price or lower cost structure:

---

## Better Alternatives to SHY (Similar Duration, Lower Cost)

### **1. Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)**

* Tracks short-term U.S. Treasuries with maturities similar to SHY (1–3 years).
* Typically has a **lower expense ratio (~0.04%)** than SHY’s 0.15%, which helps *total cost efficiency*. ([etf.com][1])
* Often trades at a lower *per-share price* simply due to share structuring and NAV.
* Duration and yield closely match SHY, making its performance profile similar. ([etf.com][1])

**Rationale**: *Essentially the same asset class as SHY but cheaper to hold, with comparable maturity exposure and yield.*

---

### **2. Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHO)**

* Also 1–3 year Treasury focus.
* **Lower expense ratio (~0.03%)**. ([Koyfin][2])
* Duration and risk profile very close to VGSH/SHY.
* Often lower share price than SHY.

**Rationale**: *Another low-cost Treasury ETF with similar duration characteristics.*

---

### **3. SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF (SPTS)**

* Similar benchmark exposure (1–3 year Treasuries) with a **very low expense ratio (~0.03%)**. ([Koyfin][2])
* Lower pricing and low cost structure.

**Rationale**: *A good passive alternative with similar exposure, ideal if you care about minimizing costs/taxes.*

---

### **4. Ultra-Short Bill ETFs (if shorter exposure is acceptable)**

If you’re willing to **shorten the maturity profile slightly** (i.e., cash-like rather than 1–3 year bond exposure), these may be useful as a *very low volatility, ultra-short alternative*:

* **iShares Short Treasury ETF (SHV)** (0–1 year Treasuries). ([etf.com][3])
* **SPDR Bloomberg 1–3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL)** — extremely short duration, very low volatility. ([etf.com][3])
* **iShares 0–3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV)** — ultra-short bill exposure. ([etf.com][3])

These are *not exactly like SHY* (maturity is much shorter), but they are lower duration and often trade at “cheaper” price points — and can behave more like cash alternatives in rising-rate environments.

---

## Why JPST Isn’t a Good Direct Alternative to SHY

* **JPST’s ultra-short duration and broader credit exposure** make it behave more like a *money market / ultra-short bond* fund rather than a pure short-duration Treasury fund.
* Its yield and performance drivers are different **because of credit spreads and manager decisions**, which may not align with a strategy built around Treasury duration.
* It may have a *higher yield* but also *different principal volatility* compared to a straight 1–3 year Treasury exposure.

**Conclusion**: JPST is *not a like-for-like substitute* for SHY.

---

## Summary Recommendation

If your goal is to **replace SHY in a rules-based strategy** (e.g., a momentum or mean-reversion model that treats duration and yield in a specific way):

* The preferred alternatives are **VGSH, SCHO, or SPTS** — *they are essentially the same asset class and have lower fees or lower per-share prices than SHY*, while retaining similar durations and risk characteristics. ([etf.com][1])

If you *want lower interest-rate sensitivity* and you can tolerate a different maturity segment (very short bills), consider **SHV, BIL, or SGOV** — but adjust your model expectations accordingly.

If you want, I can provide recent yield, duration, and expense ratio figures for these alternatives to quantify the similarities/differences with SHY in detail.

SHY, VGSH, SCHO, or SPTS make a comparison table
```

Here’s a structured comparison table of the four **short-term U.S. Treasury ETFs** you asked about: **SHY, VGSH, SCHO,** and **SPTS**.

| Metric                          | **iShares 1‑3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY)** | **Vanguard Short‑Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)** | **Schwab Short‑Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHO)** | **SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF (SPTS)** |

| **Underlying Exposure**         |                       U.S. Treasuries 1–3 Yr |                      U.S. Treasuries 1–3 Yr |                         U.S. Treasuries 1–3 Yr |                            U.S. Treasuries 1–3 Yr |
| **Expense Ratio**               |                                       ~0.15% |                                 ~0.03–0.04% |                                         ~0.03% |                                            ~0.03% |

| **Duration / Maturity Profile** |                          ~2.5 years (1–3 yr) |                     ~1.9–2.0 years (1–3 yr) |                            ~2.5 years (1–3 yr) |                           ~1.9–2.0 years (1–3 yr) |
| **Liquidity / AUM**             |                                    Very high |                                        High |                                       Moderate |                                          Moderate |

**Sources for key metrics:**

* *Expense ratios and yield comparisons:* SCHO typically has the highest recent yield with the lowest fee; VGSH and SHY yields are similar, with SHY slightly lower and higher fees. SHY’s expense ratio is significantly higher than the others. ([Mezzi][1])
* *Duration / maturity profile:* All four ETFs target short-term Treasuries (1–3 years), with slightly varying effective durations based on index methodology. VGSH’s average duration is often reported around ~1.9 years. ([Vanguard Advisors][2])
* *Liquidity / asset size:* SHY and VGSH have larger assets and deeper liquidity compared with SCHO and SPTS, which have smaller but still substantial assets. ([Mezzi][1])

### Notes on Each ETF

**SHY (iShares 1–3 Year Treasury Bond ETF)**

* Classic 1–3 year Treasury exposure.
* Higher expense ratio (~0.15%) relative to peers.
* Generally used for very low credit risk and more traditional short treasury duration. ([BlackRock][3])

**VGSH (Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF)**

* Very similar maturity profile to SHY.
* Low expense ratio (~0.03–0.04%).
* Yield tends to be close to or slightly above SHY’s, with a slightly lower total cost. ([Vanguard][4])

**SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF)**

* One of the lowest fees in this group (~0.03%).
* Often reports the *highest current yield* among the typical 1–3 year Treasury ETFs.
* Good choice if minimizing cost and maximizing yield *within the same maturity bucket* is important. ([Mezzi][1])

**SPTS (SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF)**

* Another low-cost alternative similar in exposure to VGSH and SCHO.
* Expense ratio typically ~0.03%.
* Performance/yield and duration very close to VGSH/SCHO since it tracks similar Bloomberg U.S. Treasury 1–3 Yr indexes.
* Liquidity and AUM smaller than SHY/VGSH but sufficient for most investors. ([Kiplinger][5])

### Practical Considerations

* **Cost Efficiency:** VGSH, SCHO, and SPTS are materially cheaper (by fee) than SHY, which can benefit *long-term net returns*. ([Seeking Alpha][6])
* **Yield:** In recent periods, SCHO has tended to show the highest yield among these ETFs, with VGSH close behind. ([Mezzi][1])
* **Liquidity:** SHY and VGSH typically have the deepest trading liquidity, which can matter for large or frequent trades. ([Mezzi][1])

### Summary

If your goal is **a low-cost alternative to SHY with similar maturity and yield characteristics**, the best alternatives in the current market are typically:

1. **VGSH** – very close substitute to SHY with significantly lower expense ratio (and similar duration/yield).
2. **SCHO** – similarly low cost and often slightly higher yield.
3. **SPTS** – also low cost, similar exposure, slightly lower liquidity/AUM.

SHY remains highly liquid and widely held, but its *expense ratio* is noticeably higher than the others. ([Seeking Alpha][6])

If you want, I can supplement this with **duration and SEC yield figures from recent filings** for exact quantitative comparisons.
