‚úÖ Main theme: **cheaper share prices, lower expense ratios, or broader exposure** while keeping the **same core asset class coverage**.
‚ö†Ô∏è Only **XOP** is actually *more expensive per share* than XLE ‚Äî but it gives a more balanced energy sector bet (less Exxon/Chevron concentration), so it was kept.

Do you want me to **further flag which replacements also have lower expense ratios** (not just cheaper price per share)? That would clarify where you‚Äôre truly saving long-term costs.

```
I invest in ETFs on roboforex with leverage 1:1 (frequently as CFD) so I doubt there is any expense ratio involved, only spread
```

Ahh ‚Äî that changes things üëç

If you‚Äôre trading **ETFs as CFDs on RoboForex with 1:1 leverage**, then:

* **Expense ratio is irrelevant** ‚Üí you don‚Äôt actually hold the ETF, so you‚Äôre not paying the fund‚Äôs management fees.
* **Your costs = spread + overnight swap (if held overnight)**.
* Therefore the **main reason to choose the cheaper alternative** is not cost-efficiency over time, but:

  * ‚úÖ **Lower share price** ‚Üí more granular position sizing (you can scale in/out with smaller steps).
  * ‚úÖ **Better liquidity / tighter spreads** (SPLG, SCHG, GLDM etc. still have strong liquidity, even if not as massive as SPY/QQQ/GLD).
  * ‚úÖ **Exposure tilt** (like XOP vs. XLE, SCHD vs. DIA).

So your replacement list makes sense from a **practical CFD-trading perspective**: you‚Äôre keeping exposure to the same asset classes but with units < \$100 where possible, which makes Avalanche-style layering more flexible.

üëâ The only case where the replacement isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù is **XOP vs. XLE**, but you gain **equal-weight energy** which tends to be more volatile (better for your strategy).

Would you like me to **reorganize the table** to focus just on what matters for CFD trading ‚Äî

* share price (granularity),
* liquidity / popularity,
* volatility differences ‚Äî
  instead of mentioning expense ratios at all?
